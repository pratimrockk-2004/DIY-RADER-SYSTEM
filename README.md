# DIY-RADER-SYSTEM
A radar system basically:
Sends out a signal (ultrasonic or RF).
Waits for reflections (echoes) from objects.
Measures distance and angle.
Plots that info on a display
Since real RF radar is complex,DIY hobby radars usually use ultrasonic sensors or cheap microwave radar modules with a servo to scan.
